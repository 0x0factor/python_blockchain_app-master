## How to contribute to the project?

All kind of contributions are welcome. If the change you are suggesting is significant, please do create an issue before working on the patch.

## Things to keep in mind

- The project is designed to be beginner friendly. There are some conscious trade-offs that I've made to keep it simple (as compared to a real-world blockchain project like Bitcoin which will involve a lot of intricacies).
- The coding style is analogous to PEP-8. It's not strictly followed, but please do keep existing style in mind while writing code and as many comments as possible (so that it's easier for others to understand).

Lastly, thanks for considering to contribute to the project.
